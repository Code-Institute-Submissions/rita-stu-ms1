# ms1: Raising Tomatoes

## About this project
[Raising Tomatoes](https://rita-stu.github.io/ms1) is an information-based website designed to provide answers and solutions to common tomato-growing problems. 

The site aims to include advice, instructions and tips for the visitor through web page articles and PDF downloads about how to grow and raise tomatoes successfully, in any climate.

__User Goals__
The goal of the site, for the user, is that they can quickly and easily find answers to common problems related to planting/growing and raising tomatoes.

__User Type__: How the Site Aims to Help the User

Whether a first-time grower or a seasoned grower, the user can find answers to their questions and solutions to the issues they face. User issues and problems include:

* where to source seeds and/or baby plants
* how to plant and grow from seed
* solutions to issues regarding plant health
* how to choose which types/varieties to grow
* pest problems
* how to maintain tomato plants (when to feed  and water, where to get good food)
* how and when to harvest tomatoes
* where to source seeds (links to external sites)
* tips about various tomato-related topics (downloadable PDFs with CTAs/links embedded)

__Other Services to Help the User__

The website aims to provide information about the best, most user-friendly products required by the user to start (or continue) to successfully grow tomatoes.

The service aims to offer the following solutions:

* outdoor growing: quality grow-pots and garden tools
* indoor growing: grow-pots designed for indoor growing (drainage)
* general growing: solutions and tips (location/types of tomatoes)

__Website Owner Goals__

The goal of the website owner merits a mention here because the site owner's motivation has an important influence on the overall design and development of the site, for example, certain desired user actions require certain technologies, which should be decided by the website owner.


## UX
The process aims to create a straightforward, user-friendly approach without distraction. As an information-based service, the design needs to support a lot of written content, structured in such a way that any user can effectively navigate the site, without "tripping over" unnecessary links or objects.

__Keeping the User in Mind__
The design is simple and to-the-point, offering an easy-to-follow pathway to allow users to quickly and easily find what they’re looking for.

Visitors to this site are mainly seeking information on a particular topic, in this case growing tomatoes. The user wants to know many things from how to source seeds to how to plant them successfully. The user's end goal is good fruit from healthy, self-grown tomato plants.

__UX With the Site Owner in Mind__
Keeping site-owner goals in mind, the end goal of the site is to generate revenue using online monetisation methods.

To achieve this, the site needs to provide a lot of content in different formats (online articles, downloadable documents, email newsletters) and will require the user to take some form of action (sign up to a newsletter or make contact via form or email). The design and development of the site will influence how the website can accommodate these needs.

__<a name="story">User Needs via User Stories</a>__

Here are nine user stories of potential visitors looking for solutions about growing tomatoes.

1. As a user, I want to find information about the best type of tomatoes to grow in my area (re available space, climate, soil, etc) with a view to raising four or five different varities.
2. A regualr user, I want to know where I can buy good heirloom tomato seeds.
3. I'm new to this site. I don't know what to feed my tomato plants and I'm looking for ideas. Can you help?
4. A new user, I LOVE tomatoes and I eat them daily. I'm thinking about growing tomatoes myself. I'd like an overview of everything I would need to start growing my own tomatoes (tools, soil, food).
5. I just found your website! I'm looking for information and resources about starting a home veggie garden – I'm interested in herbs, carrots, peas, tomatoes and courgettes. Which are the easiest, and quickest to grow? What type of soil is best? How much space would I need? How would I obtain good quality seeds?
6. I've visited this site before and I came here today because I have a greenfly problem! I need to find out how to combat pests in my veggie garden, specifically my tomato plants. I'd prefer non-chemical solutions, if possible.
7. I'm new here and I really want to grow my own tomatoes but my problem is space. I live in an apartment with a small balcony, so I have very limited space for growing anything. Any ideas?

These user needs are assessed in the [Testing](#test) section to see how and if the website offers a solution.

## Features

Existing Features

__Feature 1: Navigation__
To help the user find their way about, the site layout has two navigation menus, a main one top-right (__nav__), and a secondary menu centred just above the footer (.flex-nav).

The navigation system is easy to find and easy to follow. Each nav menu links to pages that aim to offer solutions to user requests.

__nav Dropdown Menu__
 The top nav utilises a dropdown menu from one of five links, __Seeds__, which has three additional links to __Heirloom Seeds__, __Hybrid Seeds__, and __About Seeds__. This dropdown menu allows the user a more specific choice.

 __flex-nav Menu__
 The flex-nav menu was originally a dropdown, a duplicate of __nav__
but due to positioning and responsive issues, and time constraints, it was changed to a regular ole menu inside a flexbox. It contains the main five links only – from here, users need to get to the heirloom and hybrid seeds pages via Seeds.

__Footer Nav__
There is a footer menu with links to the disclaimer and privacy policies (.policies), and a link to the contact page. This the only position for these links - they are not the priority of most visitors, but they are there if anybody is interested in viewing the site's policies.

A note on the contact page: should any user wish to contact the website owner, there are plenty of contact opportunities already on every page (email address top and bottom of each page, plus contact form). The decision was made to not clutter either navs (nav or flex-nav) with another link. This lack of clutter will be more user-friendly on handheld (small screen) devices.

__Embedded Links__

All written content includes __embedded links__ to take the user to more information on a specific topic. Some links lead to external sites, for example those in the Related Content section (lower page).

__Feature 2: Forms__

There are __two subscriber forms__ (.subscr), one at the very top of each page and one at the bottom, near the footer. The subscriber form is developed and designed as an unobtrusive call-to-action (CTA) to benefit users who wish to receive weekly updates (tips, advice, solutions).

There are two email links (mailto:) at the top and bottom of every page to offer the user another form of making contact with questions or queries.

__Feature 3: Downloads__
The design aims to accommodate downloadable PDFs to offer the user an offline/printable version of the information they've been looking for (and have now found, hopefully).


Feature 1 allows users to ...
Feature 2 ...

__Features Left to Implement__
..* __Selector Tool__: would be a very useful feature to offer users (time constraints and lack of current skills means developing a working tool for this project is a bit beyond me at the moment).
..* Recipes page, including downloadable PDFs
..* Expand site with non-seasonal veg/herbs
..* Blog: an active blog with comments enabled for healthy, open discussion between users.
